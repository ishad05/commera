## 📊 Bulk Operations

LS Shop provides powerful bulk operation capabilities:

- **Bulk SAC/SAV Creation**: Create multiple product configurations at once
- **Bulk Image Upload**: Upload and associate product images in batches
- **Bulk Publishing**: Publish multiple products to the website simultaneously
- **Consolidated Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports across all items

## 🔧 Configuration

### Language Setup
Configure supported languages in `hooks.py`:
```python
website_route_rules = [
    {"from_route": "/", "to_route": "/en"},
    {"from_route": "/<path:app_path>", "to_route": "/en/<path:app_path>"},
]
```

### Payment gateway integration

LS Shop reads enabled gateway profiles from `bwh_payments`. Checkout filters those profiles by the
cart currency before it renders them. Stripe, Telr, Razorpay, Tabby, and PayPal can therefore share the
same checkout flow without gateway-specific template code.

PayPal uses the Orders v2 hosted checkout and supports currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, and AUD.
It does not accept SAR, AED, KWD, BHD, QAR, or INR, so it is hidden for carts in those currencies.
Configure its credentials, redirect URLs, profile, Mode of Payment account, and webhook as described in
[SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md#paypal).

For Tabby BNPL, use the `Tabby Gateway Settings` supplied by `bwh_payments`.
